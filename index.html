                Pandora's Box
            </h2>
            <p>
                Pandora's Box is a mythical artifact in Greek mythology. Long ago, there lived two brother Titans, Prometheus and Epimetheus; although Titans, they pledged loyalty to Zeus and the Olympians.
                As a reward for their loyalty, Zeus granted them the responsbility of creating the first creatures to live on Earth. Epimetheus first created the various different animals throughout the land,
                while Prometheus took his time to create mankind. However, Epimetheus had used up all forms of protection to form his animals and thus Prometheus was left without any protection to offer
                humans. As a result, Prometheus asked Zeus to borrow fire to give to man, but Zeus refused as fire was only for the Gods; undeterred, Prometheus stole the flame and presented it to man anyways.
                Caught in the act, Prometheus was chained to the side of a mountain, left to be eaten by the birds by day and regenerate his flesh by night.

                Zeus wasn't satisfied with just punishing Prometheus; he decided to punish humnakind as well for accepting the gift of fire in the first place. He created a beautiful woman called Pandora,
                modeled after the Greek god of love Aphrodite, and blessed with wisdom, beauty, grace, kindness, and health. Zeus had he become Epimetheus' wife, who even after repeated warnings from his brother
                Prometheus, still married Pandora anyways. At the wedding, Zeus presented Pandora with a box with the warning to never open it; Pandora, however, was overcome with curiousity and opened it.
                Terrible things flew out of the box, introducing greed, envy, hatred, pain, disease, hunger, poverty, war, and death into the world for humankind to suffer. Pandora managed to shut the lid before
                the last thing could escape as well: hope. It is this hope that humans hold onto to survive the horrors that Pandora let out of the box.
