            <p>
                Zeus was the chief Greek deity, representing the sky and the weather. He ruled as head over all the other Olympians and was considered the father of both gods and men.

                According to myth, Zeus was born as a son of Cronus (sometimes Kronus), the king of the Titans. Cronus had learned of a prophecy detailing his dethroning at the hands of one of his children.
                As a result, he swallowed his children as they were born. His wife, however, saved Zeus by hiding him in a cave, where he subsisted with the help of a nymph and guarded by young warriors.
                Zeus matured and led a revolt against the Titans, eventually suceeding in dethroning his father and casting the Titans to Tartarus, the deepest pits of the underworld.
