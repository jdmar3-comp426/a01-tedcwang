            <p>
                Pandora was the first human woman created by Zeus (more specifically, Hephaestus on the instructions of Zeus). Upon her creation, each god of Olympus blessed her with a gift, laying
                way to her divine beauty, wisdom, grace, health, kindfulness, and generosity. Her origin story is an explanation of why there is evil in the world, presenting her curiosity and opening
                the box as the reason why. Originally Pandora's "box" was actually more of an urn, jar, or vase; interpretations and translations since the original have slowly changed it to being a box
                instead.
